### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Yathavan Pushpanathan, an aspiring web designer & developer based in Toronto, Canada. After graduating in 2018 with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Ryerson University, I spent the last few years learning and working across various scopes of digital development; from static webpages to full stack applications. I take great delight in researching new technologies and applying them to my practice, be it a web application or a simple coding problem. Outside of programming you can find me painting, traveling, playing league of legends, or exploring new restaurants!

Here is a list of some of the technologies I am currently working with:

React
JavaScript ES6
Express
Java
MongoDB
Git
Heroku
Node.js

I am always looking for new opportunities where I can learn cool technologies and apply my skillset! If you have any questions, or just want to say hello, feel free to contact me.ðŸ˜Š
